# 🎮 Physics Conqueror: The Knight of Physiland  
_Educational Physics Game Bridging Teachers & Students_

---

## 📖 Introduction

**Physics Conqueror: The Knight of Physiland** is an educational 2D game designed to make physics learning more engaging and interactive, especially in remote learning environments.  
The project was originally inspired by the challenges faced during the Covid-19 pandemic, when students were required to study from home, often resulting in a lack of motivation and ineffective learning.

This game bridges teachers and students by integrating a **Content Management System (CMS)**, allowing teachers to set custom quiz questions and manage student accounts, while students can practice and learn through an interactive and fun gaming experience.

Developed with **Unity 2D**, **C#**, and **Tilemaps**, this project demonstrates how educational games can supplement traditional learning.
